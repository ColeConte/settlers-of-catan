This repo contains a Settlers of Catan implementation in Java that was a past group project for a software engineering course.
Settlers of Catan is a board game with a fairly complex rule set. There were plenty of challenges implementing the logic of
the game and the resource trading interactions between users. This project presented some interesting design challenges as well,
namely the hexagonal shape of the board's pieces.

This was a very fun project to put together, especially thanks to the great dynamic with my partners Seline and Andrew!
